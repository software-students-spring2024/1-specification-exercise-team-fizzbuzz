## Stakeholders

### Jannah Mokhtar:
- When buying my friend a gift ...
    - I'm not sure if they’d like this gift or not, their taste and preference.
    - figuring out their sizes and measurements **– esp the shoes, can’t get them shoes >:( –** is very difficult.
    - I like to be shown online links for easy and cheap purchase
    - I take extra credit in finding a gift that connects us (or bridges our interests)
- When I'm splitting a gift among my other friends ...
    - it poses a lot of issues with payment
    - people keep opting in and out, and the person who pays has to keep a manual tally of who's contributing and who paid already
- I like to use Pinterest boards becuase it can ...
    - help find connections between friends.
    - help me get more inspiration
    - teach me about their vibes
    - they are very telling of a person
    - something like that can help inspire me to get gifts for someone because I get a feel for their personality/aesthetic
- I find it superficial and unnatural to get a person I don't quite know a gift of (for example) a character from a show/film they like if I didn't come to learn of that myself. I don't want to be 'told' what to get a person by a friend or otherwise; it is nicer to make that discovery and feel like you're learning about a person.
- It is important to be able to find the easiest, fastest, cheapest places to get the gifts as it would save me time looking for where I can find something I saw online.
- On WeChat, there is a feature where you can scan items, clothing, accessories, etc. you find daily and be given links to where you can buy something that matches to that item.
- When splitting up the cost of a gift amongst more than one gifter, I often find that one person bears the weight of buying the gift and then isn't paid back by everyone involved, so a way to guarantee the price can be split amongst more than one person would be helpful
    - There are restaurants in Abu Dhabi that allow you to split the bill across every one at the table so something like that would be great.

### Hamdan Zoghbor:
- Friends sometimes end up buying similar/repeated gifts.

### Baraa Al Jorf:
- I don't like spending the time thinking about what to get them
- I always procrastinate or forget, so I often end up in a race against time. Would be nice if I'm notified in advance.
- It's awkward to ask about their size.
- I usually coordinate between many applications to plan out buying a gift which can be very cumbersome.

### Rameen Mahmood:
- Would be very nice if there's a tool to recommend what I should buy given certain properties of the gift giver.
- DISCOUNTS! I love saving money so I would like if the tool finds me the cheapest options.
- I keep receiving generic gifts I hate and which I'd rather get the monetary value of instead.
