## Stakeholders

### Jannah Mokhtar:
- When buying my friend a gift ...
    - I'm not sure if they’d like this gift or not, their taste and preference.
    - figuring out their sizes and measurements **– esp the shoes, can’t get them shoes >:( –** is very difficult.
    - I like to be shown online links for easy and cheap purchase
- When I'm splitting a gift among my other friends ...
    - it poses a lot of issues with payment
    - people keep opting in and out, and the person who pays has to keep a manual tally of who's contributing and who paid already
- I like to use Pinterest boards becuase it can ...
    - help find connections between friends.
    - help me get more inspiration
    - teach me about their vibes

### Hamdan Zoghbor:
- Friends sometimes end up buying similar/repeated gifts.

### Baraa Al Jorf:
- I don't like spending the time thinking about what to get them
- I always procrastinate or forget, so I often end up in a race against time. Would be nice if I'm notified in advance.
- It's awkward to ask about their size.
- I usually coordinate between many applications to plan out buying a gift which can be very cumbersome.

### Rameen Mahmood:
- Would be very nice if there's a tool to recommend what I should buy given certain properties of the gift giver.
- DISCOUNTS! I love saving money so I would like if the tool finds me the cheapest options.
- I keep receiving generic gifts I hate and which I'd rather get the monetary value of instead.

-  if I have a friend and I see they like this show, it seems superficial. You like the show friends, she doesn’t know but if you find out it seems weird
-  fine if you don’t know them

-  finding connections between you,
-  Pinterest boards is very telling of a person
-  I get more inspiration
-  learning about their vibe

-  it matters less if you have things in common and it’s finding connection
-  I know she likes a certain quirk or whatever
-  even if I don’t get it, when you get gifts, the goal is to make the other person happiest, so it doesn’t matter as much if I can relate to it or not but it’s more what they’re feeling and there’s bonus points if it’s a reference or something you share

-  direct links, looking for things online (finding the easiest, fastest, cheapest places to get the gifts would really add a bonus, to make a bit more of a difference), flaking about the app would it give you a hint what to get your gift

- On WeChat, they used to scan a QR code, it also has
- We chat, one recognized item and it shows links to where to get it from

-  if people are paying cash, cards, how to split that up
-  person who buys that gift, there are issues with someone being paid back the money
-  it’s usually how to pay people back, in Abu Dhabi restaurant they have split the bill

-  it would be cool if people have incentives to write what they are going to get
-  in order to build people’s profiles, you want doc martens or something, if I go out it on your profile, it would increase the accuracy of who you are. There should be an incentive to increase that

-  nothing else to add
